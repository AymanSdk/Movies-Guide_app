Of course! I'd be happy to help you create a professional README/documentation for your movie guide app. A good README should provide clear and concise instructions on how to use your app, what technologies it utilizes, and any necessary setup steps. Below is a template you can use as a starting point for your documentation:

# Movie Guide App

## Description

The Movie Guide App is a web application that allows users to search for movies and get detailed information about them, including ratings, cast, plot, and more. It utilizes the [Movies Database API](https://www.moviesdatabaseapi.com) to fetch movie data and presents it in an easy-to-navigate and visually appealing interface.

## Features

- Search for movies by title or keywords.
- View detailed information about each movie, including ratings, release year, runtime, genre, and plot.
- Discover the cast and crew of each movie.
- Save favorite movies to a personal watchlist.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AymanSdk/Movies-Guide_app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd Movies-Guide_app
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## API Key Setup

To run the app locally, you need to obtain an API key from the Movies Database API. Follow these steps:

1. Visit [Movies Database API](https://www.moviesdatabaseapi.com) and sign up for an account.

2. Once you have your API key, create a new file named `config.js` in the root of the project.

3. In `config.js`, add the following code:

```js
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
```

4. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual API key.

5. Save the `config.js` file.

## Usage

- Enter the movie title or keywords in the search bar and click "Search" to retrieve a list of matching movies.
- Click on a movie from the search results to view detailed information about it.
- To add a movie to your watchlist, click the "Add to Watchlist" button on the movie details page.
- To remove a movie from your watchlist, click the "Remove from Watchlist" button on the movie details page.
